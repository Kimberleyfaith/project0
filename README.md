# Instructions to Play

- Introduce the name of the players.

- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

- Player One will select a token. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
