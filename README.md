# Project 0 - Tic Tac Toe

This is a basic tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with jQuery.

This game allows users to enter their names, and the display will prompt each user, by name, to play when it is their turn. This game also has a score board to keep track of the winner per game.
